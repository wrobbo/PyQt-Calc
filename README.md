# PyQt-Calc
A simple calculator made with Python, PyQt, and QSS for styling. Not completely polished, simply an exercise to further practice my Python and Qt skills.

The UI itself was created with Qt Designer and the code autogenerated with PyQt's pyuic5 utility. The styling however was done with a QSS stylesheet.

In order to run this, simply download the three files, navigate to the directory and run 'main.py'.
